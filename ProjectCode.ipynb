In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.

    "2. **Model Access**: \n",
    "   - DINOv2: Use official repo, not just Hugging Face\n",
    "   - DINOv3: Request access to checkpoints\n",
    "   - SAM: ViT-B recommended, can compare with L/H if compute allows\n",
    "3. **Dataset Splits**:\n",
    "   - Train on `trn` split\n",
    "   - Validate on `val` split for model selection\n",
    "   - **Only report final results on `test` split**\n",

    "   - Larger backbones (Small → Base → Large) generally improve performance\n",

    "### 📊 Evaluation Protocol (Professor's Guidelines)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Train on `trn` split** (if doing any training/fine-tuning)\n",
    "2. **Validate on `val` split** for model selection and hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "3. **Report final results ONLY on `test` split**\n",
    "4. **Metrics**: PCK@0.05, PCK@0.10, PCK@0.15\n",
    "5. **Backbones**: Compare DINOv2 ViT-B vs SAM ViT-B\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔬 Suggested Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Baseline Comparison**\n",
    "   - DINOv2 ViT-B vs SAM ViT-B\n",
    "   - With/without mutual nearest neighbor\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hyperparameter Tuning** (on val split)\n",
    "   - Matching thresholds\n",
    "   - Feature normalization strategies\n",
    "   - Ratio test thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dataset Analysis**\n",
    "   - Per-category performance\n",
    "   - Effect of viewpoint changes\n",
    "   - Effect of scale changes\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Advanced Methods** (optional)\n",
    "   - Window soft argmax refinement (GeoAware-SC)\n",
    "   - Multi-scale features\n",
    "   - Feature aggregation strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- All code follows professor's recommendations (Base models, official repos, proper splits)\n",
    "- The pipeline is modular - easy to swap backbones or add new methods\n",
    "- Visualization utilities help debug and understand model behavior\n",
    "- Start with small `max_samples` for quick iteration, then scale up\n",
